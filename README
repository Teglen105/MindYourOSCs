The current OSX version currently only works for developer and research headsets. 
I've contacted Emotiv about this, and hope to have a new version of the 
library files soon so that I can build a copy for consumers. 

For the Windows version, download the Windows version of Control Panel, 
and copy the edk.dll and edk_utils.dll files into the same directory 
where MindYourOSCs.exe is ( or just put MindYourOSCs.exe into the Emotiv
directory)
